# Shikimori Galaxies
> Theme for [Shikimori](https://shikimori.one/) by @flykins

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.0.0-pdw?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white&logoSize=amd&label=release&labelColor=black&color=gray)](https://shikimori.one/) 
[![Boosty](https://img.shields.io/badge/SUPPORT-pdw?style=for-the-badge&logo=boosty&logoColor=white&logoSize=amd&labelColor=black&color=orange&link=https%3A%2F%2Fboosty.to%2Fpdw)](https://boosty.to/flykins)

The theme is written for general use, but first of all it is written for one anime lover, so the theme does not support the builder of its backgrounds or wallpapers. The theme works in multiple browsers, adapted for many devices. The theme has been redesigned in minimalistic concepts, fronted by multiple aspects of the site. THIS THEME IS NOT A PROFILE COVER.
